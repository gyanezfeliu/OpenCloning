# How to contribute?

First of all, thanks for being here and taking the time to check the contribution guidelines.

You can contribute to this project in different ways, not only in the form of code. Here are some potential ways you can contribute:

* ðŸ§¬ **As a researcher (potential user)** you can provide feedback on the usability of OpenCloning, ask for new features, or simply share how you think it could be integrated into your workflow. In the future, there should be a way that you can try the tool without installing it in your computer.

	The recommended way for this is to create a github issue with your feedback or request in the right repository. If you don't know how to do this, you can also send an email to [genestorian@gmail.com](mailto:genestorian@gmail.com), your request will be included in an issue. However it is strongly recommended that you do this through a github issue: **your feedback and requests are valuable contributions to this project**, and issues provide a way for you to get credit for that.

    * The issues with both `no-code` and `help wanted` labels contain calls for feedback to improve some of the existing interface elements. That could be a good place to start ([link](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3Ano-code)).
    * If your contribution concerns a request for a change or feature on the user interface, make an issue in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues/new). If you can, it is best if you accompany the request with a mockup interface. Here you can find some example issues in which a mockup is suggested [with paint](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues/6) and [with Figma](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues/7), a tool for designing prototypes of user interfaces.
    * If your contribution concerns a request for more broad functionality (e.g. support for a certain cloning technique), make an issue in the [main repository](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/issues/new). See this [example issue](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/issues/2).

* ðŸ’» **As a developer**:
    * If you want to help with existing issues, check the issues labeled with `help wanted` in the [main](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+), [backend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_backend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) or [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) repo.
    * If you want to suggest changes or additions to the code that affect only the backend or frontend, create an issue in the [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/issues/new), or [backend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_backend/issues/new). You can discuss the implementation in an issue, or make a pull request.
    * For major application changes that require changes in the frontend and backend, or changes in the schema describing sequences or sources, make an issue in the [main repository](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/issues/).
    * You can also provide general feedback on the installation instructions, etc. through a github issue in the relevant repository.
* ðŸ’»+ðŸ§¬ **As a researcher with some programming knowledge** you came to the right place! OpenCloning was started as a side project of a researcher, and you can use it as a way to get started with contributing to Open Source. Even if you have no experience in web, you can still make important contributions to the project.
	*  If you are familiar with python, you can  contribute to the backend.
	*  If you are familiar with the web basics (html/css/JavaScript), even if you do not know React (the JavaScript library) you can probably get an idea of how the frontend works.

	If you do not know where to start, some issues might be labeled with `good first issue` in the [main](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning/labels/good%20first%20issue), [frontend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_frontend/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [backend](https://github.com/manulera/OpenCloning_backend/labels/good%20first%20issue) repos. They will consist of a defined and relatively simple task concerning a small part of the project, so that you can contribute without necessarily understanding the whole application. In any case, if the project excites you, you want to contribute in some way, but you do not see how, please do get in touch through [genestorian@gmail.com](mailto:genestorian@gmail.com) telling something about you, and if you have some ideas for the project.
